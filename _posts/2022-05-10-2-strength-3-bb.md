# Two Strength, Three hypertrophy

A simple program based loosely on Layne Norton's PHAT program (loosely in that it's inspired by the split, not the progression scheme).

## Reasons

I've looked back at my logs for the last few years, and a recurring theme is not being able to tolerate volume due to life stressors/conditioning. This is an attempt to address that.

## Framework

Progressions for days 1 & 2: ramp up the weight on each set.
Progression for days 4-6: double progression method

### Day 1

1. Single Arm Pull up: 5 sets of 3
2. Pendlay Row: 5 sets of 6
3. Overhead Press: 5 sets of 3
4. Dips: 5 sets of 6

### Day 2

1. Deadlift: 5 sets of 6
2. Pistol Squats: 5 sets of 3
3. Ab Wheel roll out: 5 sets of 3-5

### Day 3

Rest

### Day 4

1. Pull ups: 5 sets 7-10
2. BB Row: 5 sets of 8-12
3. BB Upright Row: 5 sets of 8-12
4. Lateral raises: 5 sets of 8-12
5. Arnold Press: 5 sets of 6-8

### Day 5

1. Sissy Squat: 5 sets of 8-12
2. Front Squats: 5 sets of 8-12
3. Nordic Curls: 5 sets of 5-8

5. Hanging Leg raises: 5 sets of 8-12
