# Push / Pull / Legs - Strength and Circuits

The last framework didn't last too long. Travel and Christmas and wanting a change of pace have all kicked in!

However, I'd still like to progress on strength - but i also have some pains and niggles i need to address, as well as chucking in some more mobility work!

The general idea is:

- Split the body into three sections: Upper body push; upper body pull; lower body.
- One strength piece using the approach from [this article](https://thibarmy.com/russian-strength-skill-the-workouts/), specifically: 5-10 sets of 1 rep, with a back off set of 3 reps. The progression is adding an extra single every workout until 10 singles are done. Then increasing the weight.
  - This is an approach i've used a lot in the past, with a lot of success!
- One accessory movement for a second section
  - why do accessory work for a different section: because i want a full body approach (i'm only doing 3 stimulating workouts a week), So, for example, i'll do my leg accessory work on an upper body strength day.
- A Circuit for the third section.
  - This is performed with 1 min rest between circuits, but no rest between exercises.
  - I'm also using a pre-fatigue set up for upper body work (this is a strength of mine at the moment, so pre-fatigue tempers the weights used),
  - and a post fatigue for lower body (Glutes in particular are a weakness at the moment) for added stimulus whilst still being able to use heavier loads.
- [Ed Haynes](https://www.coastalfitnesshk.com/coastal-fitness/meet-the-team/ed-haynes/) mentioned that i may be lacking dedicated work on my lats - so I'm sticking in Kayak Rows
