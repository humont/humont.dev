# A List of Strength Training Methods

This is a living document cataloguing a variety of different training rep, set, and programming schemes I've liked and used over the years. The only requirements for inclusion are any combination of: i) it works; ii) I liked it.

Some of these are progression schemes, others are just structures that i can use as a framework when i'm looking to "exercise" versus training for some specific goal.

Because my bias leans towards strength training, most of the methods have a focus on increasing weight lifted.

## Strength Methods

### HML - Heavy-Medium-Light

Heavy: 1-3 (or 3-5 if legs) reps.
Medium: 5-7 (or 8-10 if legs) reps.
Light: 12-15 (or 15+ if legs) reps.

Pick a weight that allows you to hit the bottom end of the heavy range for an exercise. For the other sets, the weight depends on that first one:

less than 100kg = -10kg/set
less than 200kg = -20kg/set
more than 200kg = -40kg/set

When you reach the top rep range on the light set, increase the weight by 5-10kg

### Strength Skill

I've ran this framework at least 6 times over the years, and found that it's especially good to rebuild a base strength after having been away from strength focused work for a long time. [Here's the link to the original article](https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/russian-strength-skill-the-workouts/).

The Basic premise:

1. Pick a weight that represents a solid "training max" (not a true 1RM, but about 90-95% of it).
2. Start by doing 5 sets of 1 with that weight.
3. Every session, add one set, until you reach 10 sets of 1.
4. Repeat the cycle with a slightly heavier weight.

I like to pick a weight i can solidly accelerate for at least the first 5 reps.

### Rest Pause / DC Training

This is one I keep going back to, and the [post detailing the method](https://www.intensemuscle.com/forum/main-forums/the-dogg-pound/20286-updated-dc-training-newbies-read-this-first-and-then-ask-questions-later) covers most of the questions around it and it's origins.

**The basic gist:**

- 3 mini sets, each separated by 10 deep breaths.
- Each mini set is to be taken to failure
- Each rep is performed with a 4 second eccentric (lowering) portion of the lift
- On the final failed rep, continue to attempt to move the weight for 5-10 seconds
- after the 3rd and final mini set, perform a loaded stretch for the targetted muscle group.

**Concrete example:**
_Using the DB Bench Press_

1. 1 set to failure with 4s eccentrics - 6 reps
2. Attempt the 7th rep, but fail to complete it, but keep trying for 5-10s
3. rest for 10 deep breaths.
4. Repeat 2 more times (managing 4 and 2 reps on each set respectively)
5. After, do a loaded chest stretch for 30-60s
6. Count the total amount of succesful reps

**Progression:**
Pick a rep target (e.g 16 cumulative reps over 3 sets), and keep repeating the exercise each session with teh same weight until you have reached it. Then increase the weight and start again.
