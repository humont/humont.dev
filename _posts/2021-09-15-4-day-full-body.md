# 4 Day Full Body

## Reasons

Over the last couple years, my focus has moved away from exercising quite a bit, and been spending most of my daily energy on programming and _other life stuff_. As a result of this, my programs have become quite low volume and low intensity - which I've compensated for by increasing the frequency. But every now and again, I want a _little_ more _oomph_!

This program should serve that purpose!

## Design

Each day is fullbody-ish... pairing upper body push with lowerbody pull, and upper body pull with lower body push.

Each workout has three sections:

1. Strength piece / Primary exercise
2. Accessory Exercise
3. Volume work

> The strength piece uses a structure I've had in my repertoire for close to a decade now - 3 sets: one heavy; one medium; one light.
> Heavy: 3-5 (or 5-7 if legs) reps.
> Medium: 7-10 (or 9-12 if legs) reps.
> Light: 12-15 (or 15+ if legs) reps.
>
> Pick a weight that allows you to hit the bottom end of the heavy range for an exercise. For the other sets, the weight depends on that first one:
>
> less than 100kg = -10kg/set
>
> less than 200kg = -20kg/set
>
> more than 200kg = -40kg/set
>
> When you reach the top rep range on the light set, increase the weight by 5-10kg

Progression for the accessory and volume work is pretty straight forward, add reps each workout if possible, add weight when I hit the top rep range (or when I feel it's appropriate).

These should take about 25-35 mins to finish, including the warm up.

I'll probably run this for 5 or so cycles.
